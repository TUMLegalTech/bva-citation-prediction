This folder archives all Jupyter notebooks written for citation analysis. Analysis investigates questions like

- how citation rate of a particular precedent changes over time,
- correlation between citation rate and appeal rate, and
- differences in VLJ behavior.

Note, however, that these are early works and that the citations were only extracted using simple regexes instead of the normalized citation vocabulary.
